REST Client and UI for sb-cloud-sql-gcp-pubip

### Spring Web UI and REST Client for REST API Service sb-cloud-sql-gcp-pubip

This is inspired from https://spring-gcp.saturnism.me/app-dev/cloud-services/databases/cloud-sql
It is part of their collection of GCP services https://github.com/saturnism/spring-cloud-gcp-guestbook. I recommend to go and refer their repo for any details. It is meant to be a personal quick reference for me to that project.
